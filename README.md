# Interactive Photos Gallery

- I have built this interactive photo gallery using HTML and CSS.
- This interactive photo gallery is also responsive for different devices.
- Clone or download the repository containing the HTML and CSS files for the gallery.
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the gallery files.
- Open the index.html file from the gallery folder in the browser using your favorite browser.
- Once the index.html file is opened in the browser, you will see four images displayed.
- Hover over each image to experience the interactive features.
- Hovering over an image will trigger a hover effect, such as zooming and backdrop-filter changes.
- The gallery is responsive and adjusts its layout and features based on the device screen size.

# Challenge 1 Explanation

- The function arrayMap accepts two parameters: an array of numbers and a target sum.
- It uses a sliding window approach to iterate through the array and check if there exists a contiguous subarray whose sum equals the target.
- I have declared three variables: start and end which define the current window, and currentSum keeps track of the sum within that window.
- If currentSum equals the target, it returns true, indicating the existence of such a subarray; otherwise, it returns false.

# Challenge 2 Explanation

- The function transformString takes a string str and transforms it based on its length.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, it reverses the string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, it converts each character to its ASCII code, separated by spaces.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, first reverse the string and then converts each character to its ASCII code.
